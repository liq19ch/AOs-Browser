# AOs-Browser
## An Astronomical Objects Browser
Astronomical objects include planets, stars and galaxies. Some objects can be considered to belong to a given constellation of objects while others (e.g. planets) move against constellations. All astronomical objects share certain properties such as distance from the Earth, apparent brightness (known as the objectâ€™s magnitude) as well as position in space. The latter is provided via two coordinates known as right ascension (RA) and declination (decl).
This project uses Java and Swing to build a browser by reading three text files of each object such as Planets, Stars, and Messier.
